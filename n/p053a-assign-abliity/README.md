# Assign-ability

When we have class A extends class B, this means that class B is more general and class A is more specific (for example, it adds more properties).

A more specific type is assignable to a more general one. Thatâ€™s why you can declare a variable of type `Perso`n and assign to it an `Employee` or `Contractor` object.
