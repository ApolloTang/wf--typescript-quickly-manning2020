# Abstract class and method

When you mark a class with the keyword `abstract` it will not be instantiable. Since an uninstantiable class is useless, it imply that abstract must be extended to be useful. 

An abstract class can have abstract method,  you don't have any implementation in abstract method, because leave the implementation of abstract method to the derived class. 

You can mimic abstract classes by marking the constructor of the base class `protected`; but a class with a protected constrctor won't let you declare abstract methods.
